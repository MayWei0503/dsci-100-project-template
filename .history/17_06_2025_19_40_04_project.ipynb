    "In recent years, predictive marketing has been widely applied in user retention strategies in the gaming industry. By pushing personalized offers and rewards to high-risk churn players, developers can significantly increase the retention rate of players (Ghantasala, 2024). Therefore, predicting which players are more likely to participate in such personalized marketing (such as subscribing to e-newsletters) is of great value for marketing promotion and user management."
