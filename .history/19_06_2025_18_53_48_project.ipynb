These logs include activity time, demographics, and engagement metrics, enabling researchers to study user engagement patterns and support HCI/AI development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the commercial gaming industry, predictive marketing is widely used to retain players by sending customized offers to those at risk of leaving (Ghantasala, 2024). Understanding which players are more likely to subscribe to newsletters can help improve outreach and user management strategies."

    "### What did we find?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, we were able to predict whether a player subscribed to the game newsletter with an accuracy of approximately **70%** on the test set. The best-performing value of *k* (number of neighbors) was **15**, chosen through 5-fold cross-validation. The most important predictors used in the model were **played hours** and **age**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Did the results match expectations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes — the findings were largely consistent with our expectations. We hypothesized that players with higher engagement (measured by total played hours) and older age might be more inclined to subscribe to newsletters, which was supported by the model’s moderate predictive performance. This suggests that play behavior and demographics carry useful information about a player’s likelihood to opt into game-related communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the impact of these findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of predictive modeling could support **personalized marketing** strategies in the gaming industry. By identifying likely newsletter subscribers, developers can **prioritize outreach**, tailor **in-game incentives**, or A/B test promotional emails for targeted segments. In academic research settings, such analysis helps understand how digital behavior relates to user engagement outside the game environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What future questions could this lead to?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can prediction accuracy be improved by including additional behavioral features such as **login frequency**, **session duration**, or **in-game achievements**?\n",
    "- How does **gender** or **self-reported experience level** affect newsletter subscription, and should those be included in future models?\n",
    "- Would a **logistic regression** or **decision tree** model offer better interpretability or accuracy?\n",
    "- How do newsletter subscription patterns change over time — could a **time-series model** be useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research could also explore **causal relationships**, rather than mere correlations, to better understand *why* players choose to subscribe."
